This mod introduces a new Healing Gun to the Game.

This weapon is complicated and requires a lot of work and materials.. but it provides instant healing during fights.
The plans of the weapons have to be researched in order to use it.

The healing is locked at six injuries per shot and two injuries per bodyparts. Scars and old wounds won't be healed by this gun.
This gun also can't regrow parts of the body or help with diseases. It is purely made to tend to injuries during battle.
